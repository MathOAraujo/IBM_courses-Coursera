# Build-a-Regression-Model-in-Keras

This project is part of IBM's Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras course.

In this course project, I will build a regression model using the deep learning Keras library, and then I will experiment with increasing the number of training epochs and changing number of hidden layers and I will see how changing these parameters impacts the performance of the model.
