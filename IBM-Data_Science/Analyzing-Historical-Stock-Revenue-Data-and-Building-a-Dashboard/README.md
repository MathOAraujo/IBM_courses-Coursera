# Analyzing-Historical-Stock-Revenue-Data-and-Building-a-Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is part of IBM's Python Project for Data Science course.

For this project, I will assume the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. My job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data I will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks I will work with are Tesla and GameStop.
